<h4>WHO CAN SEE YOUR DATA </h4>
							<p>
								Apart from NUKATOMIC, your data can be accessed by others in the following situations:
							</p>

<h4>OTHER PLAYERS AND USERS.</h4>
							<p>
								Social features are a core component of our games. Other players and users may, for example, see your profile data, in-game activities and read the messages you have posted.
							</p>
<h4>PARTNERS WORKING FOR NUKATOMIC.</h4>
							<p>
								NUKATOMIC has partners to perform services for us. These partners process your data only at and according to NUKATOMICÂ´s instructions to provide the Service, such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Other companies and public authorities.</b>
								In order to combat fraud and illegal activity, we may exchange data with other companies and organizations and provide it to public authorities in response to lawful requests.
								We may also disclose your data based on your consent, to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Advertising and Social Media partners.</b>
								The Service includes features from our partners, such as social media interaction tools and in-game advertising. These partners may access your data and operate under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their data processing practices.
							</p>
							

<h4>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</p></h4>
							<p>Our Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.</p>

							<p class="mt-5 font-weight-semibold">
<h4>	YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS</h4>

							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Your other rights.</b>
								You also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object how we use or share your data, and restrict how we use or share your data. You can always withdraw your consent, for example by turning off GPS location sharing in your mobile device settings.
								We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge). You may also contact your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area for unresolved complaints.
							</p>

							<p class="mt-5 font-weight-semibold">
<h4>	COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
							</p>
							<p>
								Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.
							</p>

							<p class="mt-5 font-weight-semibold">
<h4>			HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</h4>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Security Safeguards.</b>
								In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Data retention.</b>
								We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.
								Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
							</p>

							<p class="mt-5 font-weight-semibold">
<h4>	AGE LIMITS</h4>
							</p>
							<p>
								We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.  If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data.  If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible.
